# Audio file conversion
When creating or downloading wav files they might not be encoded right. We can fix this by using ffmpeg. I have made a powershell script that encodes all the audio files in the "audio_files" directory. Simply open powershell in the test_debug folder and type "./audio_convert.ps1"
